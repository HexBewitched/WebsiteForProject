  <!--
  Assasination of Franz Ferdinand: He was assasinated by a Serbian man and the government wanted it and it made Austria Hungary mad causing the war to kick off
  Alliances: The war would have been a small battle between two countries, but since European countries had such strong alliances the war expanded and all the alliances joined increasing the scale of the war
  Lusitania-Unrestricted submarine warfare: Germany shot the Lusitania with a torpedo because they though it had supplies for the war in it, it was a passengar ship with supplies in it, making the US mad starting to give them ideas to join ww1
  Woodrow Wilson: He originally planned to stay neutral but after the Lusitania was shot down and many other things Woodrow Wilson joined the allied sides(Great Britian, Italy, Japan, Serbia, France, and Russia) to "make the world safer for democracy", he is the one that allowed the us to join the war
  Kaiser Wilhelm II: He was the leader of Germany and he was indecisive and ineffective but was very strategic and his belief that Austria Hungary had infinite power caused having a peace treaty increasingly difficult so he was overthrown. he was one of the people that made the war increasingly difficult to end
  American Neutrality: America originally stayed neutral during the war but then the Germans sunk ships and killed American people so they stopped being neutral. it caused the us economy to grow and get ships sunk when trading causing the us to join the war
  Selective Services: Selective Services also known as the draft was a bill that congress passed in 1917 to get more men to fight in the war, it forced men between 21-30 to fight except if they were in college or in specilized carrers that provided needed services for the war
  Espionage Act of 1917: It stopped getting any information about national defence because they though it could be used against the US to protect themselves from the central powers
  Chemical Weapons: two types of gas were used Chlorine Phosgene and Mustard gas, Chlorine Phosgene: a gas that causes people to choke and die, and Mustard Gas: which gives painful burns on skin and and anywhere usually causing them to die by choking on their own blood due to internal bleeding one of the most deadly weapons during ww1
  Second Battle of the Marne: The second Battle of the marne went from July 15th, 1918 to August 6th, 1918, it took place on the marne river valley in France, it was a distraction to launch a bigger attack on Flanders in Belgium but was predicted by the Allies and held off, being overall not sucessful one of the most important battles leading to a loss for Germany
  Christmas Truce of 1914: After overhearing songs and stuff from the German Trenches the British troops started talking to them, then they decided to have an impromptu truce to, exchange gifts, repair trenches, bury casualties, and play football(soccer)
  Post War Europe: After ww1 there were many changes to the countries of Europe first, Austria Hungary was broken up into Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslvia, secondly the Ottoman Empire lost most of their land and only left with the land thats now known as turkey because they lost the war
  Economic Effects of WWI: During the war the workforce was increased from 40 million to 44 million a whole 10 percent, and the unemployment rate dropped, but after the war many people were layed off and the people who were fighting in the war couldnt get jobs because there were more workers than now needed because there are a lot less people needed in the military
